# Classification  Machine Learning Model using Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent
This Jupyter Notebook file performs a machine learning model using Logistic Regression and gradient descent algorithms. The model is trained on dataset from [Supervised Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## Usage
To run this Jupyter Notebook file, make sure you have the required dependencies installed and datasets](https://github.com/Billl-11/Logistic-Regression-Machine-Learning-Model/blob/main/exam_Score.txt) downloaded. Then, open the file in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in sequence. You can modify the code as needed to experiment with different parameters and see how they affect the model's performance.

Note
The model's accuracy may not be representative of its performance on real-world data.
